4. Unzip all files from downloaded archive - `libs_prebuilt.zip/libs_temp/` into `X:/ReCrafted/libs/`.
5. Create `X:/ReCrafted/username.txt` file with your nickname.
6. Run generate_project_X.(sh/bat) file in the root directory to build needed projects.
7. Done! For example: open .projects/vs2015/ReCrafted.sln for C++ project.

Warning: If you pull newly created files for C++ project, you must run generate_project_X.(sh/bat) again and then reload project.
