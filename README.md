A engine/game with voxel-based, fully destructible planets. 
An old project of mine that I worked on for several years. It has been rewritten many times. 
The current tech stack is: C++ 11, DirectX 11, PhysX 4.1, Ultralight based UI and Mono as a scripting backend. Project generated using Premake.
I have no intention to develop this project further and it is left as a portfolio.
